= Paragraphs =

The simplest way to enter text into a wiki is similar to doing so in a a word processor.

You just start writing. :)

The only anomaly is that you have to hit "enter" ''twice'' for a paragraph:

== Input in the editor form ==
{{{
First paragraph.
Still first paragraph.

Second paragraph.

Third paragraph.
}}}

== Display ==

First paragraph.
Still first paragraph.

Second paragraph.

Third paragraph.
= Dividing rules =
== Input ==
{{{
First part.
----
Second part.
}}}

== Display ==

First part.
----
Second part.
