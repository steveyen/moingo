= Creating more pages =
The easiest and best way to create more pages is to:
 * think of a ''good'' page name.
 * edit an appropriate page, add a link to the new page, and save it.
 * click on the link to the new page
 * prepare to edit using:
  * an empty page.
  * a page template (a list of templates is displayed on the left).
  * (!) the list of similar page names shown to ensure that there isn't any slightly different named page on the same topic.
 * start editing, fill the page with content, and save it.

(!) This method makes sure that new pages are always accessible from links on already existing pages.
