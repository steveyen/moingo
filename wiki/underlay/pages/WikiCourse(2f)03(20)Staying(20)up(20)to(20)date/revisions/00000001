In a wiki, lots of things can change in a short time, since anyone can edit, add, or remove pages at any time.

For this reason you can easily follow these changes on the page '''RecentChanges'''.

Listed for every change is:
 * a link to a page showing differences.
 * a link to the changed page (as well as the information for this page).
 * when the change was made.
 * who made the change.
 * a comment made for the change.

(!) If you are logged in to the wiki, you can set a temporal ''bookmark'' using this page. In that case, the wiki will remember which changes you have already seen and will only display the new ones after that.
