MoinMoin ''DesktopEdition'' is the easiest way to run moin, without much installation and without separate server software (this is why its built-in server is also called the ''standalone server'').

It is intended as a local personal information manager.

== Installation ==
 * if you don't already have Python installed (Linux systems often have it by default, Mac OS X also, Windows usually needs manual installation), get it from http://python.org/
 * download the moin distribution archive from MoinMoin:MoinMoinDownload
 * unpack it (will give some moin-1.x.x directory)

If you prefer to work with a repository checkout instead of a release archive, the procedure is like above, but you additionally have to unpack the underlay pages:
 * `cd moin-1.x.x/wiki`
 * `tar xf underlay.tar`

== Running ==
 * `cd moin-1.x.x`
 * `./wikiserver.py` (or click on `wikiserver.py`)
 * now a fresh moin wiki will run on http://localhost:8080/ :)
 * you can terminate the wiki server either by using Ctrl-C or closing the window

== Wiki Server Configuration ==
If you need to use a configuration different from the standard configuration you can edit the `wikiserverconfig.py` in the toplevel directory, see the comments there.

(!) By default, moin only listens on the localhost interface. Before opening it to a wider audience, please check if the security settings of moin are what you want. Especially the `DesktopEdition` and `acl_rights_*` settings might need changes if you don't use it for personal use and on localhost only.

== Wiki Server Logging Configuration ==
See `wikiserverlogging.conf`.

(!) You maybe usually don't want to change that, but you ''can'' - e.g. if you like to have more log output for debugging.

== Wiki Configuration ==
See the `wikiconfig.py` in the toplevel directory. HelpOnConfiguration lists the configuration options. You maybe also want to look at the sample config in the `wiki/config/` directory.
