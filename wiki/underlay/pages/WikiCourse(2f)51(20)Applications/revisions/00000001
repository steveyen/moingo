= Applications =

A wiki is usable for quite a few applications, because there few requirements to use it and the content can be anything.
You can use it for everything that can be displayed by linked text pages.

== Examples ==
 * personal notes (instead of wasting paper)
 * conference protocols
 * to-do lists
 * news on wiki homepage, asynchronous communication
 * common creation of documentation
 * brainstorming
 * personal or collective link lists
 * efficient alternative to e-mail or phone
 * much more
