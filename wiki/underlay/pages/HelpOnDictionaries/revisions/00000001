The dictionary markup can be used to store key-value pairs like in a dictionary or glossary. It uses definition lists (see HelpOnLists). A dictionary page used by the system has to have a name ending with `Dict` (see `page_dict_regex` on the page HelpOnConfiguration).

Dictionaries can be either shared or private (only you have read access to them under your homepage).

== How does it look? ==
This is an example:
 var1:: value1
 var2:: value2
 var3:: value3

And it looks like this in the page source:
{{{
 var1:: value1
 var2:: value2
 var3:: value3
}}}
 /!\ The leading space and the space after '::' are important.

== Dictionaries for translations ==
Dictionaries can be used to translate user-specified words with auto-substitution<<FootNote(this is an alternative for the distributed PO-Files, which are used instead in MoinMaster wiki)>>. If you want to use that a dictionary has to be named in the form ''Language''Dict (examples: !GermanDict, !FrenchDict, !SpanishDict, etc.).
