= Finding information =
!MoinMoin has many ways to find information in the wiki:
== Searching ==
 * '''Search field in the navigation area on the top of the page'''
  * For a title search, type in the search keywords and hit "enter" (or click on '''title''').
  * For a full-text search, type in the search keywords and click on '''text'''.
 * Menu item '''FindPage'''
  * Includes indexes of all pages sorted by page names and words in the page name.
  * Advanced search functions.

(!) The title search can also be used to quickly navigate to pages that you only roughly know the title of.

You can find further information on the help page HelpOnSearching.
