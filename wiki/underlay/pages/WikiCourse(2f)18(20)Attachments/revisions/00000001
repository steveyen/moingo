With MoinMoin you can directly append files to a wiki page.

== Input ==
{{{
[[attachment:letter.txt]]

{{attachment:foto.jpg}}
}}}

== Display ==

[[attachment:letter.txt]]

{{attachment:foto.jpg}}

(!) As long as the files aren't uploaded:
 * the links are grey (like links to non-existent wiki pages).
 * an alternate image, like a paper clip, is displayed for non-existent embedded pictures.

You can click on it and upload the file from your computer's file system to the wiki using your browser. Then the design is regular and:
 * links are blue.
 * the image appears.
