This page describes features that are not yet completed or need practical testing before they are added to the standard feature set. They may disappear or be changed substantially!


== Bidirectional language support ==

 * `language_default` (in wikiconfig) sets the default language of a wiki's ''content''
   * the HTML `lang` attribute of a page's `BODY` tag is set to this language
 * for each language MoinMoin supports in its user interface, a correspondent `<<lang>>` macro exists, e.g. `<<en>>`
   * this macro sets HTML `lang` attributes for paragraphs etc.
   * it also changes the text direction
