 * !WikiWiki means “fast” in Hawaiian.
 * A WikiName is a word composed of two or more words with each separate word beginning with an upper case character.
 * Always use the singular for a WikiName, otherwise multiple pages for one topic might be created.
 * Be bold when updating pages.—Back ups from older versions of each page are created automatically.
 * By setting a bookmark on RecentChanges you can easily see what has been changed since your last visit.
 * CategoryCategory shows an overview of all available categories.
 * Clicking on a page's title will give you a list of all pages that are currently linking to it.
 * Do not create a new, very short page for a sub-topic when it fits on an already-existing page.
 * For your account name you should use a WikiName (!FirstnameLastname).
 * In your user preferences you can use your own CSS to change the default layout.
 * Just type in URLs ([[http://www.example.net]])—the wiki will convert them automatically to a link.
 * In your user preferences you can edit the list of your quick links.
 * In your user preferences you can use regular expressions for subscribing pages; with “`.*`” you subscribe to all pages.
 * OrphanedPages shows pages that no other page links to by a WikiName.
 * Set the ''Language'' in your browser's preferences or in your moin user preferences to ''English'' to read the wiki menus and messages in English.
 * Setting ''Language'' in your user preferences to ''English'' will allow you to receive emails from the wiki in English.
 * The use of [[CategoryCategory|categories]] helps organize your information.
 * Use WikiName``s instead of URLs when linking to a page within the wiki.
 * Use ''<<GetText(Exclude underlay)>>'' on FindPage to exclude the wiki's help pages from the fulltext search.
 * WantedPages shows WikiName``s where currently no page exists.
 * When writing your email address, use `<<MailTo(Firstname DOT Lastname AT example DOT net)>>` to avoid spam.
 * Wikis are cool—especially if you have read the help pages (see HelpContents). ;-)
 * With `{{attachment:myfile.png}}` you can create a link to an attachment (and use the link to upload the attachment).
 * With “@``SIG``@” you can sign a text.
 * With “<<GetText(Add Link)>>” you can add the current page to your list of quick links.
 * With “<<GetText(Check Spelling)>>” you can initiate a spell check.—Only add unknown words if you are absolutely sure that they are spelled correctly.
 * With “<<GetText(Comments)>>” you can toggle on/off the view of comments on the current page.
 * With “<<GetText(Info)>>” you can look at the revision history of the current page.
 * With “<<GetText(Subscribe)>>” you can be informed about changes on the current page via email.
 * You can avoid that a WikiName becomes a link if you place a `!` in front of the word.
 * You can change the default size of the editor window in your user preferences.
 * You can create or edit the list of your quick links in your user preferences.
 * You can use other pages than the FrontPage as your personal start page, e.g. RecentChanges or your own homepage.
 * You may use non-ASCII characters (e.g. äæéłöŧüñ) on wiki pages and for the page names, too.
