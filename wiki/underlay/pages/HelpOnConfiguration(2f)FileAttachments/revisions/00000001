The [[HelpOnActions/AttachFile|AttachFile action]] enables a page to have multiple attached files. Since file uploads could be abused for DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, `AttachFile` is an action that may be disabled by the wiki administrator (by adding `actions_excluded = ['AttachFile']` to wikiconfig).

This is all you usually need to do for configuration.

= How attachments are handled =

Attachments are stored "privately" in the `data/pages/` directory (with paths like `data/pages/<pagename>/attachments/<filename>`) and can only be retrieved by using the Attach''''''File action (via URLs like `http://example.org/mywiki/<SomePage>?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=filename.ext`).

/!\ The `direct serving method` (deprecated since long) was finally removed in moin 1.7.0. If you have used it until now (`attachments = {...}`), please copy your attachments into your data directory (and make sure they arrive at the right location there).
