After account creation and login, you can change your user preferences and settings (click on the link <<GetText(Settings)>> at the top of the page).

The default values should be fine for most of the preferences, but you might want to change:

 * the size of the editor input box (depends on your screen resolution and font preferences).
 * maybe the preferred language (not necessary with a correctly configured browser).

Then click on the '''save''' button at the bottom of the page.
