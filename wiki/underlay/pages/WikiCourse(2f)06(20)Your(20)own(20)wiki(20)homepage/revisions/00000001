= Your own wiki homepage =
After creating an account you can see your own name in the navigation area, which is linked to a page of the same title: your personal homepage! 

If you click on this link, you can see one of the unique characteristics of wikis for the first time: instead of getting a ''404 not found'' error when a non-existent page is called, the wiki helps you create the page.

After following the instructions displayed, the wiki will display a template of your own homepage in a form.

You can change this template, give an optional comment, and then save the page by clicking '''save'''.
