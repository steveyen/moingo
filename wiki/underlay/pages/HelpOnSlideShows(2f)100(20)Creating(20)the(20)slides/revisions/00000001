= Creating the slides =

Put a headline on top of your page (as you see above) because in <<GetText(DiaShow)>> mode, the wiki page title won't be visible (as the whole wiki frame stuff won't be visible, only the page contents).

If you do not want to enumerate your headlines, use `#pragma section-numbers off` at top of your page.

(!) Don't forget to fill in some valuable content.

For your convenience, there is a SlideTemplate - use it.

Put `<<Navigation(slides)>>` (upper) or `<<Navigation(siblings)>>` (lower) at bottom of your page:

<<Navigation(slides)>>

<<Navigation(siblings)>>
