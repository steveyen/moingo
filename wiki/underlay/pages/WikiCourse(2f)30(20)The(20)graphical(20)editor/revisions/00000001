= The graphical editor =
As an alternative to the input of wiki markup using the simple text editor, MoinMoin also offers a graphical WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor, which is similar to usual word processing.

Technical requirements: an up-to-date version of Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape or Internet Explorer with !JavaScript activated.

You can set the preferred editor in your user preferences, but you can also switch to the other editor while editing.

Advantages of the GUI editor are that it is:
 * prettier.
 * simpler.

Disadvantages of the GUI editor are that it:
 * takes longer to load.
 * is less flexible.
 * is not yet error free.
