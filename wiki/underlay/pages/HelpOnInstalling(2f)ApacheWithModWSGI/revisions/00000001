= Why use mod_wsgi? =

See the [[http://modwsgi.org/|mod_wsgi homepage]].

(!) Please note that its "daemon mode" should be the preferred way to use it (and this is the reason to prefer mod_wsgi over mod_python).

= Basic configuring =

 1. Install mod_wsgi
 1. Set up a wiki instance
 1. Edit `wikiconfig.py`
 3. Changes to Apache configuration
 1. Restart Apache

The sample configurations below are for a wiki instance called `mywiki` installed in a directory `/var/www/moin/mywiki` with the main !MoinMoin installation installed in python's default site library path. The wiki appears as URL `/mywiki` under the server - ie `http://my.ser.ver/mywiki`.  You will need to change these to reflect your installation.

== Install mod_wsgi ==

Most people will just add a `mod_wsgi` package to their current operating system installation.  If you are building from source then you should consult the mod_wsgi documentation (it is rather easy if you have a development environment installed).

Make sure you have this line in your apache configuration or mod_wsgi will not work:
{{{
LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
}}}

After this restart Apache and make sure that it starts successfully (also check the the error log).

== Set up a wiki instance ==

This is done as shown in [[HelpOnInstalling/WikiInstanceCreation|WikiInstanceCreation]]. Its recommended to first configure the wiki with cgi and check that it works, then change the configuratin to use mod_wsgi. This allows you be sure that any problems are in the mod_wsgi transition rather than the basic MoinMoin installation.

 1. Copy moin.cgi into your wiki directory
 1. Configure `httpd.conf` as cgi first (Alias shown is for 1.7.0, for other versions please change it):
  {{{
Alias /moin_static170/ "/usr/share/moin/htdocs/"
ScriptAlias /mywiki "/var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.cgi"
}}}

Restart Apache and make test that your wiki works.

== Edit `wikiconfig.py` ==

Make sure you use only absolute paths:
{{{
data_dir = '/var/www/moin/mywiki/data/'
data_underlay_dir = '/var/www/moin/mywiki/underlay/'
}}}

Test that the wiki works after this change.

== Changes to Apache configuration ==

After your wiki is running as cgi script, convert it to run with mod_wsgi. 

If you run your wiki as cgi as we recommended before, remove or comment the !ScriptAlias directive:
{{{
#ScriptAlias /mywiki "/var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.cgi"
}}}

Add this to the same virtualhost definition (Alias shown is for 1.7.0, for other versions please change it):
{{{
    # this is for icons, css, js (and must match url_prefix from wiki config):
    Alias /moin_static170/ /usr/share/moin/htdocs/

    # this is the URL http://servername/mywiki/ you will use later to invoke moin:
    WSGIScriptAlias /mywiki /var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.wsgi

    # in case you want your wiki under the root url (http://servername/), use this instead:
    #Alias /robots.txt /usr/share/moin/htdocs/robots.txt
    #Alias /favicon.ico /usr/share/moin/htdocs/favicon.ico
    #WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/moin/mywiki/moin.wsgi

    # create some wsgi daemons - use someuser.somegroup same as your data_dir:
    WSGIDaemonProcess moin user=someuser group=somegroup home=/home/someuser processes=5 threads=10 maximum-requests=1000 umask=0007
    # for mod_wsgi >= 2.0 you can append this to have a nice ps aux display:
    # display-name=wsgi-moin

    # use the daemons we defined above to process requests!
    WSGIProcessGroup moin
}}}

Please also have a look into `moin.wsgi` - you maybe have to change some `sys.path.insert` instructions so Python can find the !MoinMoin code and the wiki configuration.

Restart Apache - everything should now work correctly.
