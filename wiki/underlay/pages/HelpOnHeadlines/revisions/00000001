== Section Headings ==
You can create headings by starting and ending a line with up to five equal signs. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.

Headings can be automatically numbered, you can enable or disable this for each page (see `#pragma section-numbers` on HelpOnProcessingInstructions) and for the whole site (see `show_section_numbers` on HelpOnConfiguration).

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing. 

 /!\ Headings may not contain wiki markup.

 /!\ You cannot indent headings.

=== Example ===
{{{
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====
}}} 

=== Display ===
{{{#!wiki green
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====
}}}

== section-numbers ==

Switches automatic numbering of section headers.
{{{
#pragma section-numbers off
}}}
off or 0 disable numbering, on or 1 enables numbering. The default mode is set by the show_section_numbers config option.

When enabling numbering, its possible to use specific heading level:
{{{
#pragma section-numbers 2
}}}
Only displays section numbers for headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6).
