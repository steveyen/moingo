= Headlines =

== Input ==
{{{
= First headline level with =-character =

... (up to "Sixth")
}}}

== Display ==

= First headline level with =-character =

==== Fourth ====
... (up to "Sixth")

(!) If a headline isn't displayed correctly, it is usually because:
 * there are invisible spaces after the concluding =-character.
 * the number of =-characters at the front and at the back doesn't match.
